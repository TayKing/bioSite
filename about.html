                <hr>
                <p>Madeline King is an aspiring Pro Soccer player and future Veterinarian. She has been working on her goals to play professional soccer for most of her life. Throughout her career as a soccer player, she has played for many different organizations and clubs. Madeline's first experience with soccer came at the early age of three at the local YMCA. She played there for two years before deciding to move on to a larger soccer-oriented organization known as the Clark County Soccer Association. She found even more success and gained a small following there as she continued to build her skills and confidence though after only two more years she had already outgrown the recreational soccer community and set her sights on a local travel soccer team where she would have more resources to grow and a larger more competitive group of girls to play with and against to test herself against and to see if she had what it takes to go all the way to the pro leagues one day. Madeline currently plays for Southern Indiana United, though she has played with and been accepted to many other travel teams in her area, she believes this is the team that will give her the best opportunities to fulfill her dreams. As she continues to play and learn we look forward to seeing just how far she will go and if her goal of world travel in the pro leagues is within sight in the upcoming years.​</p>
